These strokes, then repeated, are sequenced together with other strokes to form patterns. If we step back and look at our lives, one might say that our journey through life is similar. We live our life one day at a time, days merge into weeks and months and years and yet we can look back at the whole as one memory. The same goes for celebrations, challenges, accomplishments, friendships, and so on. All these components of our lives are strung together to form ever-changing patterns, ultimately forming a work of art we call life. What is remarkable about the art of life is that is that it is constantly changing. Much like what you see when you look through a kaleidoscope, none of it stays the same. It\u2019s an ever-changing display of beauty flashing before your eyes.
