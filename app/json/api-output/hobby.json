Jerk. \n\nOkay, so I haven't actually been inside, but who knew there was a geocaching store? \n\nPersonally, I'm more into metal detectors and searching for Spanish coins and gold bullion. I haven't actually found any yet and I don't have a metal detector at the mo' but the future is bright!  That said, the Geocaching niche is interesting. Seems to be good bonding for families and adventurers who want to get out and go hunting. \n\nNext time I'm in LoL I will drop in and report back with a fuller description. There's a new Peruvian restaurant, Koki's ,nearby and Hungry Harry's is pretty famous for BBQ, Larry's Deli serves up a good Cuban sandwich, and Ukelele Brand's has the best chicken strips around and there's no extra charge for the mosquito bites. So even if you don't find any caches you can eat well.\n\nHappy hunting!!!\"", "al:ios:app_store_id": "284910350", "fb:app_id": "97534753161", "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "traceparent": "00-f0f8c9016ac80d1c5b383ab9bb1643ca-4b8af1a177b644c3-01", "og:ttl": "2419200", "og:url": "https://m.yelp.com/biz/tampa-bay-geocaching-store-land-o-lakes-3"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_large_assets/a8d26394324f/assets/img/seo_metadata/yelp_og_image.png"}]}}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "Premium Member Collection: Name Tag", "htmlTitle": "Premium Member Collection: Name Tag", "link": "https://shop.geocaching.com/default/trackable-items/gear/premium-member-collection-name-tag.html", "displayLink": "shop.geocaching.com", "snippet": "In 2000, Geocaching.com was started as a hobby site with 75 geocaches.
